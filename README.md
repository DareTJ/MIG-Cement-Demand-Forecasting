# Cement Demand Forecasting Across Multiple Sites
This project applies machine learning to forecast cement demand across multiple distribution sites. By analyzing historical consumption, seasonality and external drivers, it delivers accurate predictions that support inventory planning, reduce stockouts and overstocking, and improve supply chain efficiency.

## üìù Problem Statement
Construction suppliers often face fluctuating cement demand across different locations. Without accurate forecasts, they risk stockouts or overstocking, leading to increased costs and project delays.  
This project builds a **data-driven forecasting solution** to predict weekly or monthly cement demand per site.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Predict cement demand for multiple sites using historical data.
- Improve inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce costs and waste.

---

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** (Replace with your data source or mark as ‚ÄúSimulated‚Äù if proprietary.)
- **Features:**
  - Date / Time
  - Site ID / Location
  - Cement quantity delivered or consumed
  - Weather / Seasonality indicators
  - Additional demand drivers (if any)
- **Size:** (Add number of records & features.)

**Preprocessing Steps:** Missing values handled, outliers removed, features engineered (lag variables, rolling averages, etc.).

---

## üîé Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Demand trends across sites
   - Seasonality & external factors
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Lag variables, moving averages, site-level encodings
4. **Modeling**
   - Baseline models: Moving Average, ARIMA
   - Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE
6. **Insights & Recommendations**
